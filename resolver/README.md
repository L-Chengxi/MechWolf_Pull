# MechWolf.io

This directory contains the code for the MechWolf website. There are two main
functions of the site: to serve as a brochure for MechWolf as well as to
host the MechWolf resolver.

The HTML and CSS of the website (_i.e._ the homepage) is a modified version of
the MIT-licensed [New
Age](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-new-age) theme. The
server is written in Python using Flask and hosted on AWS Lambda via Zappa.
