Python
------

MechWolf is written in Python, a high level programming language that is the

from `machine learning <http://keras.io>`_ to `web server development
<http://flask.pocoo.org>`_ and now flow process automation. In order to get started
with MechWolf, you'll need to learn Python, specifically Python 3.
