Installation
============

From PyPI (recommended)
-----------------------

MechWolf is available from `PyPI <https://pypi.org>`_, the Python Package Index.
Installation is a breeze. In your :ref:`virtualenv <virtualenv_instructions>`,
use the ``pip`` command to install MechWolf::

    $ pip install mechwolf

.. note::

    This will take a **long** time to compile on a Raspberry Pi.

From source
-----------

If you would like to use the development version of MechWolf, which is **not
guaranteed to be safe or stable**, you can install MechWolf directly from the
GitHub repository using the following command::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/MechWolf.git
