What is MechWolf?
-----------------

MechWolf is a Python package for continuous process automation. It consists of
two main parts: a Python library that allows you to describe and analyze
apparatuses and protocols as well as an IoT system to execute the protocols.

Who made MechWolf?
------------------

MechWolf was primarily developed by `Benjamin Lee
<http://www.github.com/benjamin-lee>`_ with Alex Mijalis, Myles Ingram, and
Nicola L.B. Pohl.

Do I need to know how to code?
------------------------------

Yes. However, we prepared :doc:`a guide for non-coders <../guide/gentle_intro>`
that will ease you into it.

Why don't you support Python <3.6?
----------------------------------

`f strings <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/>`_ are the best thing
since sliced bread and `asynchronous generators
<https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0492/>`_ are pretty neat too. In all
seriousness, execution depends on asynchronous code and Python 3.6 has the best
support.

Is this only for [insert field here]?
-------------------------------------

No. MechWolf is field agnostic. If it flows, MechWolf is capable of handling it.

How can I get support?
----------------------

If the error message is in red, then it means that the error was generated by
MechWolf. Follow the instructions given by the message, if applicable. If the
error message is in white, that means it was generated by Python. Look up the
message (you'll likely get a StackOverflow hit) and see if that helps you
resolve the issue.

Still, if those steps haven't solved the problem, `create an issue
<https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/MechWolf/issues>`_ on the MechWolf GitHub and
someone will work to resolve the issue there.

Can I use MechWolf for commercial purposes?
-------------------------------------------

Yes. MechWolf is licensed under [insert license here].

Where can I get high-resolution versions of MechWolf's logo?
------------------------------------------------------------

High-res versions are available in the `logos directory <http://github.com/benjamin-lee/MechWolf/logos>`_.

How do I cite MechWolf?
-----------------------
