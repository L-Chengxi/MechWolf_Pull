Data Integrity
==============

Your experimental data are precious. That's why MechWolf takes special measures
to make sure that none of it is ever lost.

How It Works
------------

When data are generated by your synthesizer, it is first held in memory on your
client while it is sent back to the hub. When the hub recieves data, it is
stored in a database file for the protocol execution. Then, the hub acknowledges
that it recieved the data. The client then removes it from its memory to free up
space for new data.

If transmission to the hub fails for any reason, the data are stored in a
database file on the client. At then end of protocol execution, the client tries
again to send it to hub. This will ensure that temporary communications
distruptions are handled seamlessly. It will try to send the data back until it
gets an acknowledgement of receipt. In the event that communications are not
restored, when the client is shut down via a KeyboardInterrupt (control+C), it
will preserve the data locally.

How to Recover Your Data
------------------------

Let's say that the internet went down during your run. [#f1]_ To get your data back,
find ``client.db`` file on your client and run ``mechwolf convert client.db``.
You will then be able to retrieve your data.
