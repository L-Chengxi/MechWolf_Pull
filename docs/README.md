  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Safety</h2>
    <p>Design, simulate, and analyze experiments <em>in advance</em> to make sure they'll work. If things do end up going wrong, Mechwolf stops the experiment right away.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Simplicity</h2>
    <p>Follow the same process as in the lab, except now in Python. Knowing just two commands, you can design an apparatus, create a protocol, and then execute it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Interactivity</h2>
    <p>Use an interactive browser-based notebook to visualize your apparatus and protocol and then monitor the experiment in real time with live graphs (no setup required).</p>
  </div>
