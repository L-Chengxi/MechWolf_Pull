  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Safety</h2>
    <p>Design, simulate, and analyze experiments <em>in advance</em> to make sure they'll work. If things do end up going wrong, Mechwolf stops the experiment right away.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Simplicity</h2>
    <p>Follow the same process as in the lab, except now in Python. Knowing just two commands, you can design an apparatus, create a protocol, and then execute it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Interactivity</h2>
    <p>Use an interactive browser-based notebook to visualize your apparatus and protocol and then monitor the experiment in real time with live graphs (no setup required).</p>
  </div>

### MechWolf doesn't bite.

Install MechWolf in one line:

```
$ pip install mechwolf
```

If you get an error (such as `mechwolf requires Python '>=3.7' but the running Python is 2.7.16`), take a look at the [installation guide](guide/installation). If you're not sure what any of this means, see the [gentle introduction](guide/gentle_intro).
