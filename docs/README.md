    <h2>Safety First</h2>
    <p>MechWolf's compiler has your back. Design, simulate, and analyze experiments <em>before</em> connecting to real hardware to make sure they'll work. </p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Simplicity</h2>
    <p>Follow the same process as in the lab, except now in Python: design an apparatus, create a protocol, execute it, and analyze the results.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Interactive</h2>
    <p>Use an interactive browser-based notebook to visualize your apparatus and protocol and then monitor the experiment in real time with live graphs.</p>
  </div>
