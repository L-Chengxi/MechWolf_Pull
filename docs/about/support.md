## If you are getting an error message

Follow the instructions given by the message, if applicable.
In general, MechWolf error messages are designed to give feedback to help you fix the issue.
If the error message is not being generated by MechWolf, look it up on Google (you'll likely get a StackOverflow hit) and see if that helps you resolve the issue.

Additionally, it may be useful to install a tool such as [stackprinter](https://github.com/cknd/stackprinter), which helps make error messages more informative by showing variables' values at the time of the error as well as context around the code that generated it (not to mention nice color coding).
